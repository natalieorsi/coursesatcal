# Code samples from my time at Cal
These are some code samples from my assignments at Cal. Do not use these to cheat, you will only cheat yourself. See the license for details!

# Why shouldn't you use my code?
You are taking this class because you want to, hopefully, use this information. CS61A is one of the best computer science classes for beginners in the world, and you are lucky enough to be taking it. So learn it! Learn IN class, learn at discussions, learn from your FREE TUTORS. You will miss that stuff when you graduate. It's not about grades once you're out, and whether you cheated your way into an A or a C you're going to have to go back and relearn all the stuff you were procrastinating, but you won't have the best resources on planet Earth at your disposal anymore. What a waste! And what a waste of tuition money. Do yourself a favor and have fun learning computer science, get off GitHub and start talking to your classmates, your professor, your GSI. You'll be a lot more appreciative of the knowledge and experiences you gain that way than you will be of having easily snagged some points off an open source website.

If none of that worked, I've included some errors and missing files. Enjoy.
